## **A brief description on how you created your web portfolio**

My portfolio is inspired by the 4 elements of nature: air, water, earth and fire. Several currents of thought consider that each element represents qualities of the human being and that all people have these qualities, but we must work to reach the center of all to achieve balance and harmony.

Each of the "About" sections were designed and written according to the characteristics that each element represents and how I feel identified with them.

I also wanted to include a section of my work with a sample of the projects carried out in these two terms.

## **What challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes**

I faced many challenges in development as initially the design I had created was very difficult to develop to be responsive in a proper way. I had to adjust it, and along the way I wanted to include more design details that lengthened the process.

I incorporated things that I had never worked with, but with the guidance of my professor Abhay Sharma and many hours of work, I finally achieved a desired result.

## **Talk about what you learned by creating your web portfolio**

I learned that sometimes as a designer the effort that should be made in development is underestimated, it is very easy to create things in Ai or XD but making them look the same and respond appropriately to different screen sizes is something that requires knowledge and patience.

I also learned that there are many wonderful resources on the web, Bootstrap seemed to me to be a very powerful library that can make life easier when developing and that a solution can always be found.
